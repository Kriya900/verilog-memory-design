ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
**ðŸŸ© Single Port RAM**
1)Implements basic read/write memory using one access port.

2)Demonstrates how data can be sequentially accessed through a single address line.

3)Ideal for low-complexity applications needing simple memory access.

**ðŸŸ¦ Dual Port RAM**
1)Introduces simultaneous read and write operations via two independent ports.

2)Enhances memory bandwidth by allowing parallel access.

3)Suitable for high-speed systems like CPU-memory interfaces or multi-core processors.

**ðŸ’¡ Verilog Implementation Techniques:**
1)Developed RTL using modular and structural design principles.

2)Applied always blocks for memory behavior modeling.

3)Created testbenches for rigorous simulation and validation.

4)Used waveform analysis tools to debug and visualize memory operations.

**ðŸ”¬ Waveform Analysis & Debugging:**
1)Memory reads/writes visualized via EDA Playground simulation.

2)Clear understanding of timing behavior and data flow through signals.

**ðŸ”— Applications in Real Systems:**
1)Embedded Systems: Low-power memory operations for IoT and MCU applications.

2)FPGA Prototyping: Used as base for algorithm testing in real-time.

3)Computer Architecture: Core design for caches, registers, or shared memory models.

****ðŸš€ Future Improvements:****
1)Optimized Features: Add latency-aware designs, error correction, or pipelining.
2)Scalability: Extend RAM size and interface with SDRAM/DRAM.

Advanced Use-Cases: Use in SoCs, hardware accelerators, and multi-level memory hierarchies.
